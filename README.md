### Introduction

Welcome to the Expense and Income Tracker Back-End project! This robust system is designed to efficiently manage users and transactions, providing a seamless experience for tracking expenses and income. Built with cutting-edge technologies, this project utilizes Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, JWT authentication, and RESTful API endpoints. Additionally, the system incorporates mailing functionality to enhance communication.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The project is powered by Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime known for its scalability and performance. Node.js enables efficient server-side development.

- **Express.js:** As a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, Express.js simplifies the development of robust and scalable APIs, making it an excellent choice for this back-end project.

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database, MongoDB is used for storing and managing data efficiently. Its flexibility allows for easy adaptation to changing requirements.

- **Mongoose ODM:** Mongoose is employed as the Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB, providing a straightforward way to model and interact with the database.

- **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is implemented to ensure secure user sessions, providing a reliable and token-based authentication mechanism.

- **REST API:** The project follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), providing a standardized and scalable architecture for building APIs.

- **Node Mailer:** The inclusion of mailing functionality enhances communication within the system, allowing users to receive important updates and notifications.

### Deployment
